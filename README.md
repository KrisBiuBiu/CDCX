# This is a webSite Build With Koa2, It can show you how to build a simple and complete website using koa2

# Attention
I saved the login account and password in the background in config.js, but in fact, it is only convenient for the use of the user. In the actual project, important information such as account and password will not appear in the configuration file, because it is dangerous. By doing so, your server will be attacked!

#Remember, don't put important information in the configuration file！
